# Microsoft Graph API Module Status and Next Steps
The module is now loading correctly and the diagnostic tools are working. The diagnostics run successfully and show the connection to Microsoft Graph API is working. When attempting to send emails, we've added extensive logging and timeout protection that should help identify where any freezing occurs.
Recommended next steps:
1. Try sending emails and check the logs at /var/log/odoo/odoo.log
2. If freezing still occurs, run the fix script: sudo bash /opt/odoo18/custom_addons/mail_graph_api/fix_freeze.sh
3. For emergency fixes without restart: sudo -u odoo18 python3 /opt/odoo18/custom_addons/mail_graph_api/emergency_fix.py
