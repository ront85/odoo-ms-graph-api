# Microsoft Graph API Integration for Odoo Mail

## Problem Summary
The mail sending functionality was freezing when trying to use Microsoft Graph API. This happened in two scenarios:
1. When testing the mail server connection
2. When sending emails with certain configurations (BCC)

## Solution Implemented
We created multiple fixes to address these issues:

### 1. Mail Server Connection Fix
- Created a dummy SMTP connection when using Graph API
- Implemented a watchdog timer to detect freezes
- Properly handled Graph API authentication

### 2. Email Sending Fix
- Added robust error handling for the email sending process
- Implemented timeout detection to prevent system freezes
- Added detailed logging for better debugging
- Fixed BCC recipient handling

### 3. Overall Improvements
- Added debug logging throughout the process
- Implemented safety measures to prevent infinite loops
- Improved error reporting
- Added token refresh handling

## Files Modified
- `__init__.py` - Added imports for the fix files
- Created `debug_patch.py` - Basic debugging infrastructure
- Created `fix_freezing_mail.py` - Initial fix for freezing during mail sending
- Created `fix_ir_mail_server.py` - Fix for mail server connection
- Created `fix_email_bcc.py` - Fix for BCC handling in emails

## How to Use
The fixes are automatically applied when using the mail server with Graph API. No additional configuration is needed.

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist, check the logs for entries starting with:
- `=== MAIL_DEBUG: ...`
- `=== MAIL_FIX: ...`

These entries provide detailed information about the email sending process.
